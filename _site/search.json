There are two principles; graphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements, and meaningful plots through aesthetic mapping.\nA good grammar will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics. A grammar provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. A grammar may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics."

Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars\ngeom_histogram for for drawing binned values, the default bin is 30\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot by using the + operator.\n\nGeom Objects: geom_dotplot\nIn a dot plot, the width of a ddot corresponds to the bin width (or max width), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation. Be warned: The y scale is not very useful. In fact, it can be very misleading.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_dotplot() of ggplot2 is used to plot a dot plot.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data.

It is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes().\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           color = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Objects: geom_boxplot\nThis will display a continuous value list.

If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by Gender in a notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           color = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining Geometric Objects\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\",\n             size = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Objects: geom_violin\nThis is designed for creating violin plot. It is a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary distribution curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines virtually interfere with each other.\nWith a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re packed side by side.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths score by Gender in a violin plot.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x = GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()"

First, let’s create three statistical graphs.\n\np1 <- ggplot(data = exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color = \"grey25\", \n                 fill = \"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\np2 <- ggplot(data = exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color = \"grey25\", \n                 fill = \"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\n\np3 <- ggplot(data = exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS, \n                 y =ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, \n              size = 0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),\n                  ylim = c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\nCreating Composite Graphics: patchwork methods\nSometimes, multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions that provide functions to compose figures with multiple graphs.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. The general syntax combines a two-column layout using the plus sign, a parenthesis to create a subplot group and a two row layout using the division sign.\nTry this:\n\np1 + p2 / p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n‘|’ will place the plots beside each other while ‘/’ will stack them:\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nPatchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities which aim to identify subplots in text:\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add themes:\n\npatchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout, patchwork also allows us to place one or several plots of graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2,\n                    left = 0.02,\n                    bottom = 0.7,\n                    right = 0.5,\n                    top = 1)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"

Once downloaded and unzipped, there are two files that are contained in this folder; one for the raw dataset and one for the notes of the dataset (similar to a readme file).\nUnzipped folder:\n\nDataset:\n\nNotes of Dataset:\n\n\n\nPreparation Steps\nPlease find below a reproducible description of the procedures used to prepare and create the analytical visualization in Tableau Desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nStep\nScreenshot\n\n\n1\nIn Tableau Desktop, in the Data Source pane, click on “Text file”.\nWhen prompted to choose a file, click on the raw dataset.\n\n\n\n\n2\nLet’s change the data source name to: Planning Area - Jun 2022.\nLet’s also change the field names according to the Notes of Dataset csv file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nThe field Time has been identified to be a numerical field. However, this is incorrect as it is supposed to reflect the Year of the record.\nLet’s change Time field’s datatype to Date.\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nLet’s create two calculated fields to distinguish the populations by gender.\nCreate a calculated field called Male Population and Female Population.\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nLet’s group the values in the Age Group field into bins of 15 to simplify our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n6\nTo show only 9 Planning Areas in our view, let’s filter the data source to only keep the Top 9 Planning Areas based on the total population.\nClick on “Add” to add a new data source filter.\nIn the Data Source Filters popup, click on “Add” to add a new filter for the Planning Area field.\nWhen prompted to choose which values to keep, select the tab “Top”, and the radio button “By field” to choose the Top 9 by Population Sum.\nClick on “Ok” to close the popup.\nClick on “Ok” again to close the Data Source Filters popup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nNow, let’s build the visualization in “Sheet 1”.\nLet’s create two calculated fields; one for columns and one for rows, to build a 3 by 3 matrix.\nDrag Columns and Rows fields to the Column and Row panes respectively. The view will look like a quadrant.\nSwitch the Columns and Rows fields from Continuous to Discrete. The view will be updated to a table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nDrag the two calculated fields we created (Male Population & Female Population) to the Columns pane.\nDrag the Age Group (Group) field to the Rows pane.\n\n\n\n9\nRight click on the axis for Male Population field and select “Edit Axis”.\nIn the popup, under the section “Scale”, tick the check-box for “Reversed”.\n\n\n\n\n\n10\nDrag the Planning Area field into the Details section of the All marks card.\n\n\n\n11\nLet’s update how the calculated fields Columns and Rows are computed - which should be based on the Planning Area field.\n\n\n\n\n12\nIn the marks card for Male Population field, change the color to teal.\nSimilarly, in the marks card for Female Population field, change the color to red.\n\n\n\n\n13\nLet’s change the view from”Standard” to “Entire View” to spread out our display.\n\n\n\n14\nLet’s remove the axis headers for both Male Population and Female Population fields.\nRight click on the axis header and un-check “Show Header” for either of the axis.\nLet’s also remove the header for the Columns and Rows fields. Un-check “Show Header” for both these fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n15\nUnder the marks card for All, drag the slider to reduce the size of the bars till the recommended size (indicated by a pipe).\n\n\n\n16\nTo format grid line, right click on the view and select the “Format” option.\nIn the format panel, click on the icon for grid lines. Under the tab “Columns”, set Grid Lines to None.\n\n\n\n\n17\nFor the male population marks card, let’s drag the SUM(Male Population) field to the label section. Right click on the SUM(Male Population) field in the marks card and click on “Format”.\nIn the format panel, click on “Pane”. Under the “Numbers” option, select “Custom”. Change the number of decimal places to 0 and the display units to thousands.\nRepeat the same for the SUM(Female Population) field.\n\n\n\n\n\n18\nRight click on Age Group (Group) field in the Rows pane and select “Sort”.\nIn the popup, change the sort order to “Descending”.\n\n\n\n\n19\nRight click the Planning Area field in the marks card for All and select “Sort”.\nLet’s sort by Sum of Population in Descending Order.\n\n\n\n\n20\nTo bring the Planning Area field as a text label for this view, let’s create a calculated field called dummy.\n\n\n\n\n21\nBring this new calculated field, dummy, into the view on the Columns panel. Ensure that the dummy field is taking the AVG and not the SUM.\nMake this dummy field a dual axis with the Female Population field.\nRight click on the axis header for the dummy field and click on “Synchronize Axis”.\n\n\n\n\n\n22\nNow, let’s format this dummy field. Right click on the dummy field’s axis header and un-check “Show Header”.\nLet’s also un-check “Show Header” for the Female Population field.\n\n\n\n\n23\nLet’s remove the measure names field from the colors section in the marks card for both the dummy and Female Population fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\nLet’s also reduce the size of the bars for the dummy field to the smallest possible size.\n\n\n\n25\nMake the dummy field’s color to be completely opaque with no borders.\n\n\n\n26\nChange the type of mark from “Bar” into “Circle” for the dummy field.\nThen, drag the Planning Area field into the text section in the marks card.\n\n\n\n\n\n27\nFormat the text label to be bigger and bold, as well as center-aligned.\nNow we have a clean and insightful view that is ready for analysis!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion of Analysis\nSo, what can we learn from this visualization that we built in Tableau Desktop?\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, when we look at the Top 9 Planning Areas, namely Bedok, Tampines, Jurong West, Sengkang, Woodlands, Hougang, Yishun, Chua Chu Kang and Punggol, there is one thing that is common. They are all HDB Residential Areas.\nLet us now analyse this view by the Age Groups. Across the Planning Areas, a key thing to note would be that Bedok is the only area which has at least 1K population for both Males and Females who are above the age of 90. Moreover, they also have the highest population of both Males and Females who are between the ages of 75 and 89. From this, we can deduce that Bedok hosts one of the highest populations of elderly who are above the age of 75.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the opposite spectrum in the Age Group, both Sengkang and Punggol seem to have the largest population of Males and Females between the ages of 0 to 14. This could indicate that these Planning Areas are most likely to host younger families who are raising children and adolescents.\nThere are only 2 out of these 9 Planning Areas, namely Sengkang and Punggol, which have a higher population in the age group of 0 to 14 as when compared to the age group of 15 to 29. Meaning they have more people below the age of 14 than in the ages between 15 to 29. Whereas, for the other 7 Planning Areas, this is the opposite, indicating a low fertility rate in general.\nWhen looking at Age Groups and Planning Areas, one section that stands out would be the Planning Area of Punggol. This is because it is notable that the population between the ages of 30 to 44 is almost the double of the population between the ages of 15 to 29. This is something that we could further analyse as a future work.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving on to the breakdown by Gender, we can determine that there are more Males than Females in the ages between 0 to 14 across all the Top 9 Planning Areas. On the other hand, there are more Females than Males in the ages between 30 to 44 across all the Top 9 Planning Areas.\nLast but not least, in overall, the populations across these Planning Areas seems to be a well distributed for both genders. This implies that we have a reasonably good gender equality in our Top 9 Planning Areas.\nThis concludes the work submitted for Take-Home Exercise 1. Thank you!"
